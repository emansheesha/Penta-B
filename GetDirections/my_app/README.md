in our case when the vehicle moves towards f  it means that it moves a point in y-axis and it'll be the direction(north) then 
the vehicle moves to l  it means that it moves a point in x-axis then
it moves to f three times it means that it moves a 3-points in y-axis then
it moves to r it means that it moves a point in x-axis then
it moves to f it means that it moves a point in y-axis then
it moves to l it means that it moves a point in x-axis then
it moves to b it means that it moves a point in y-axis 
if we want get x it will be equal the sum of ponits of x (here equals 3) and in the problem solving it'll be equal x*2 (6).
if we want get y it will be equal the sum of  (x-1) (here equals 2) and the startand the point.
if start or end equal (r or l) it returns 0 else returns 1
so in the problem solving it'll be starts with 1 and ends with 1
so the sum of start+ (x-1) +end equal (4).
